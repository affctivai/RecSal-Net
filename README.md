# RecSal-Net
This is the PyTorch implementation of the EEG-Deformer in our paper:
ChaeEun Woo, SuMin Lee, Soo Min Park, Byung Hyung Kim, "RecSal-Net: Recursive Saliency Network for Video Saliency Prediction", 2025.
It is a recursive transformer network that combines a transformer-based encoder with a recursive feature integration strategy for Video Saliency Prediction (VSP).
